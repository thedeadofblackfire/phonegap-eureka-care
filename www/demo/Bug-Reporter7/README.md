Bug-Reporter7
=============
Bug Reporter7 is a web based application to help you and your team keep your work organized by moving Bug Reporting into one centralized system.
Driven by the powerful [Framework7](http://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7), Bug Reporter7 allows Users and Developers to advance development of their projects by submitting Bugs, which other Developers can try to fix.

Key Features
============
**NOTE: This is the Demo of Bug Reporter7! There is only a limited set of features that can be used right now.**

* **Submit bugs, report issues**: Help advance development of your project by reporting issues you encounter. Just tap „Submit“ and enter the details.
* **Work in groups**: Groups help you and your team organize your work. See your existing groups or apply for new ones.
* **Announcing: Announcements**: Announcements are messages by admins or moderators to help you quickly find out about new bugs and issues.
* **Show off your personality**: Quickly change themes or tint colors to create the experience you want. Your settings are synchronized via the Cloud.
* **Night and Day. Yours to choose**: Timed Theme allows you to automatically apply the Dark theme when it's night. And when it's day, the theme will be Light again.
* **With Updates, it keeps getting better**: Every release of Bug Reporter⁷ now comes with Software Update to keep your app always up to date, because Updates are downloaded automatically.

* NOTE: Groups and Announcements currently not available in Demo *
* NOTE: Tips is currently under construction and will receive an update soon. *

Software Update
===============
Introducing Software Update, a new method to update the app's offline cache.
Available in "Settings", Software Update searches for any changes to the cached files (```cache.php```) or update files (```update.json```) and applies them on demand or when the app is restarted.
Software Update automatically searches for updates on launch and informs users when an update is available.

Software Update requires working Application Cache. Current approach relies on PHP, so this requires a PHP capable server.

Modern UI & Swipe to Delete
===========================
Modern UI adds various UI aspects found in iOS 8, like Compose View and Swipe to Delete in Mail, to Bug Reporter⁷. When swiping left on a bug, buttons are normally static. With Modern UI, buttons slide in as you move your finger (or mouse). And with Swipe to Delete, you can swipe even further to close, reopen or delete a bug without tapping on a button.

This is Modern UI. Included in Bug Reporter⁷.
